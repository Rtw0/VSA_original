- <i>Charlie: Unbelievable.</i>
- <i>MacKenzie: Unbelievable.</i>

00:01:28,525 --> 00:01:31,060
Don: That is a subpoena for a reporter
to appear before a grand jury.

6
00:01:31,062 --> 00:01:33,328
If they had grand juries in East Germany
and East Germany still existed,

7
00:01:33,363 --> 00:01:34,730
then that's where
we'd be right now.

8
00:01:34,781 --> 00:01:36,281
Put it away, Rebecca.

9
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:38,400
And nobody says a word about
this to anyone tonight.

10
00:01:38,402 --> 00:01:41,286
- <i>Jim: What happens now?</i>
- Monday morning, he'll appear before a grand jury.

11
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:43,872
He'll be asked to name
his source and he'll say...

12
00:01:43,907 --> 00:01:45,908
- No problem.
- He'll refuse.

13
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,743
Tuesday morning,
the prosecutor...

14
00:01:47,745 --> 00:01:49,411
Who wants Will's head
hung in his den.

15
00:01:49,413 --> 00:01:52,664
...will go to a judge to get an order
for Will to answer the question.

16
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:54,466
Wednesday morning,
armed with the order,

17
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:57,386
the prosecutor will ask him
again and he'll refuse again.

18
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,172
Thursday morning,
we appear before the same judge,

19
00:02:00,256 --> 00:02:02,007
who the prosecutor will
inform that Will has refused

20
00:02:02,058 --> 00:02:03,642
to comply with
a court order and then...

21
00:02:03,676 --> 00:02:06,562
- Everybody goes home.
- Because you're too big to jail?

22
00:02:06,596 --> 00:02:08,931
- That's right.
- Will, you've been wrong about everything.

23
00:02:08,982 --> 00:02:11,400
- Every step of the way.
- Do you really think this administration is going

24
00:02:11,434 --> 00:02:13,268
- to lock up a reporter...
- I didn't think they'd raid a newsroom and that happened.

25
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,320
...who exposed a disinformation
campaign that resulted...

26
00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:17,823
I didn't think Neal would have to flee extradition,
and Neal's in Venezuela.

27
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:19,942
And I didn't think they'd have
the sack to subpoena you,
